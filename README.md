# Fuzzy-Logic-Encryption-and-Decryption
In this contribution, a novel method for using fuzzy logic in cryptology is presented. This approach is quite different than previously used approaches. In this algorithm, a fuzzy logic design shall correspond to a unique encryption since in it the message is given as input to the fuzzy logic system one integer at a time and the corresponding output is generated. Thus, the message is encrypted. For decryption, the exact fuzzy logic design should be used. Also, there can be many outputs of the fuzzy logic design, more the number of outputs more secure the message shall be. The compromise between processing time and desired security level can be controlled by fixing the number of outputs of the fuzzy logic design. The algorithm was implemented in matlab environment.
